# üöÄ Markdown Conversion Toolkit

**Convert LLM-generated Markdown to DOCX/RTF with One Click!**

## üéØ Motive
In today's AI-driven workflow, it's common to get assistance from Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini for content creation. However, these tools often output text in **Markdown format** by default. When you need to:

- Submit professional documents in Word format
- Share content with non-technical team members
- Use legacy editors that don't support Markdown

...manual conversion becomes tedious. This toolkit solves this problem by providing **instant conversion** of Markdown text (copied from LLMs, editors, or websites) to DOCX/RTF formats through simple click operations.

## üåü Key Features
- **Clipboard Magic** - Convert copied Markdown without creating .md files
- **Drag-and-Drop** - Convert existing Markdown files by double-clicking
- **LLM-Optimized** - Perfect for ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude outputs
- **Custom Output** - Choose your preferred save location

## ü´† Prerequisites
1. **Pandoc**  
   [Download installer](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)  
   *Ensure it's added to system PATH during installation*

2. **Python 3.7+**  
   [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
   *Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation*

3. **Git (Optional)**  
   Required only for cloning repository  
   [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## üñ• Installation
### 1. Clone Repository
```bash

### 2. Configure Paths
Edit `config/config.bat` using Notepad/VSCode:
```bat
